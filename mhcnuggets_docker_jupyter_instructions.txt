1. Clone the repository to your workstation, if not done so already:
git clone https://github.com/KarchinLab/mhcnuggets

2. Change directories into the repository:
cd mhcnuggets/

3. Create file called Dockerfile, and contents of the file should be:
FROM python:3

RUN pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn pandas tensorflow keras jupyter

COPY mhcnuggets mhcnuggets

CMD jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --allow-root

4. Run the following command from within the same directory as the Dockerfile to build the docker image:
sudo docker build -t mhcnuggets_jupyter .

5. Once complete, create a directory on your workstation outside of the repository.

6. Inside this new directory, create a file called docker-compose.yml, with the following contents:

version: '3'
services: 
  mhcnuggets:
    image: mhcnuggets_jupyter
    container_name: mhcnuggets
    ports:
        - "8888:8888"

7. While still in the same directory that docker-compose.yml resides in, run the following command to start the docker container:
sudo docker-compose up

8. After a minute or so, you should see log files outputting to your terminal, there will be a link with a unique token in the logs similar to this:
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=examplecharacters

9. Copy the link seen in your logs (with the unique token included) and enter it into your browser. You should now see jupyter notebook with mhcnuggets already installed. You are able to upload files, and run predict and train modules.
